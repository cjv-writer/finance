    "## Introduction\n",
    "This module introduces you to the some of the methods used to measure the performance of portfolio managers. Since the vast majority of capital in financial markets is managed by professional investors, being able to measure the quality a portfolio manager is essential to maintaining an efficient market. For instance, if investors were unable to assess a portfolio managers performance, investors could continue to invest with the and this would result in an inefficient allocation of capital. The competition for investors funds via well performing portfolios is what keeps the allocation of capital efficient. Hence the evaluation of a portfolio, and by extension its manager, is a crucial task in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty with determining the performance of a portfolio is understanding how to trade off the return that a manager generates against the risk that the manager takes to obtain their return. For example, a portfolio anager could take an extremely risky position and make a huge amount of money from it. Looking at retruns earned, they would appear to be extremely talented. However, they could also have been lucky that the risk they took on didn't materialise. A good portfolio manager is one which is able to consistently earn good returns without having to take on a a disproportionate amount of risk. Unfortunately simply stating that we have to consider risk isn't sufficient. What kind of risk? Total risk, systematic risk or perhaps another kind? As we will see, the measure of performance is somewhat driven by the investment approach of the portfolio manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant issues arise when the portfolio manager changes the composition of the portfolio. Usually managers change portfolios in an effort to \"time\" the market (increase investment when the market is going up and reduce it when its going down). Market timing is very difficult to do successfully but the ability to do it successfully is extremely valuable. We will examine several approaches to determine if a portfolio manager is able to successfully time the market. Finally, often times we are more concerned with what decisions led to a portfolios performance, whether it be good or bad. If we can identify what decisions were made well (led to good performance) and those that were made poorly (led to poor performance) then we can take corrective action. Performance attribution is a technique that can allow the investor to understand where portfolio performance comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computing Returns - The Conventional Theory\n",
    "Before we consider risk adjusted returns, we first consider how one can compute \"average\" returns that have been earned by a portfolio. Perhaps the most obvious approach is to compute the arithmetic average of returns, $\\bar{r}$. This is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\bar{r} = \\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{t=1}^{T}r_{t}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The arithematic average is a good measure of the central tendency (expected vaule) of a distribution and hence is often used as an input into portfolio optimisation models that require an estiamte of the future expected value. However, the downside of the arithmetic average is that it is not necessariliy a return that can be realised. To see this, consider for example a portfolio that starts at \\\\$100 at $t=0$, goes up to \\\\$150 at $t=1$ and back down to \\\\$100 at $t=2$. The returns per period are\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    r_{1} &= \\frac{150 - 100}{100} = 0.5\\\\\n",
    "    r_{2} &= \\frac{100-150}{150} = -0.33\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The arithmetic average of these two returns is $\\bar{r} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(0.5 -0.33) = 0.085$ and it appers that we have profited when in reality we have earned no money whatsoever. The reason for this discrepancy is that the reative gain in period 1 was larger than the relative loss in period 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric average can overcome this problem as it corresponds to a return which can be earned. The geometric average, $\\bar{r}_{g}$ is given by the expression\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    (1+\\bar{r}_{g})^{T} = \\prod_{t=1}^{T}(1+r_{t}) \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\bar{r}_{g} = \\left(\\prod_{t=1}^{T}(1+r_{t})\\right)^{1/T} - 1\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Inspecting the above equation, it is clear that the geometric average corresponds to the $T$-period compounded return and hence earning the fixed return $\\bar{r}_{g}$ for $T$ periods would yield the same wealth as the sequence of returns $\\{r_{1}, r_{2}, \\ldots, r_{T}\\}$ where wealth is reinvested. One thing to note is that we do not weight one time period more or less than any other when computing the geometric average and for this reason it is sometimes called a \"time-weighted\" return. However, there may be times where we do wish to weight one time period more than another. This leads to dollar-weighted returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dollar weighting returns simply applies a greater weighting to a periods return if we have a greater amount of wealth invested as that periods return is more important in determining ur overall performance. While at first glance appearing ike a complicated task, the tool required to compute dollar-weighted returns is already familiar, the internal rate of return. The key to computing dollar-weighted returns is to treat the investment like a project with capital flows in and out. Consider for example the problem where cash is withdrawn or added to a portfolio. Imagine that you observe the following decisions made at time $t=\\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n",

Note that the dollar-weighted return $r_{d}$ is different from the time-weighted return $r_{g}=7.81$\\%. This is because the stocks performance in the second period, when more money is invested, is worse than the first period, dragging the dollar weighted return down.\n",

    "## Adjusting for Risk\n",
    "On their own, the measures of average return (arithmetic average, time-weighted and dollar-weighted) are insufficient to assess a portfolio managers performance as they don't account for risk. One simple approch to making a risk adjustment is to simply rank managers who have similarly risky portfolios. One could then argue that the median manager is an appropriate benchmark as half of managers outperform this and the other half underperform. However, such a simple analysis can miss some of the nuances associated with risk. Take equity investment for example. While it may seem like all equity investments would carry a similar risk, different managers can focus on different subsets of equity (small cap, high beta, growth stocks, etc) and hence risk can vary across this universe. A better approach is to compute measure of risk adjusted performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk Adjusted Performance Measures\n",
    "We begin by outlining the four most common performance measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Sharpe ratio: $\\frac{\\bar{r}_{P} - \\bar{r}_{f}}{\\sigma_{P}}$\n",
    "2. The Treynor ratio: $\\frac{\\bar{r}_{P} - \\bar{r}_{f}}{\\beta_{P}}$\n",
    "3. Jensens alpha: $\\alpha_{P} = \\bar{r}_{P} - (\\bar{r}_{f} + \\beta(\\bar{r}_{M} - \\bar{r}_{f}))$\n",
    "4. The information ratio: $\\frac{\\alpha_{P}}{\\sigma_{e_{P}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each performance measure uses either a different measure for performance ($\\bar{r}_{P} - \\bar{r}_{f}$, $\\alpha_{P}$) and/or risk ($\\sigma_{P}$, $\\beta_{P}$, $\\sigma_{e_{P}}$). Each measure has its appeal, but similarly, each measure has its limitations. The user of these measures should be aware of which circumstances allow the appropriate use of each of these measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Performance Measure | Definition | Application |\n",
    "|:--|:-:|:--|\n",
    "| Sharpe | $\\frac{\\bar{r}_{P} - \\bar{r}_{f}}{\\sigma_{P}}$ | Choosing among portfolios competing for the overall risky portfolio |\n",
    "| Treynor | $\\frac{\\bar{r}_{P} - \\bar{r}_{f}}{\\beta_{P}}$ | Whan ranking portfolios that will be mixed to obatain the overall risky portfolio |\n",
    "| Information Ratio | $\\frac{\\alpha_{P}}{\\sigma_{e_{P}}}$ | When evaluating a portfolio to be mixed with the benchmark portfolio |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting Performance Measures\n",
    "While the Sharpe and Treynor ratios can be easily used to rank competing portfolios, we are also interested in understanding what the differences between two ratios means economically. For example, say we have two portfolios $P$ and $M$ with respective Sharpe ratios $S_{P} = 0.69$ and $S_{M} = 0.73$. While we can say that $P$ underperformed $M$ (as measured by the Sharpe ratio) we don't know what the difference of 0.04 means economically. To address this, Leah Modigliana and her grandfather Franco developed the $M^{2}$ measure. The idea is to combine an active portfolio ($P$ say) with a risk-free asset (T-bills) to create a new portfolio $P^{*}$. We select the the amount of the risk-free asset such that the standard deviation (risk) of $P^{*}$ is equal to the benchmark portfolio $M$. Because these portoflios now have the same risk, we can compare their performance by comparing their returns. Hence, the $M^{2}$ measure is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    M^{2} = r_{P^{*}} - r_{M}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do the exact same exercise but use systematic risk ($\\beta$) in place of total risk ($\\sigma$) and compare the returns of portfolios with the same $\\beta$. This is somtimes called the $T^{2}$ measure."

    "## Style Ananlysis\n",
    "Style analysis was introduced by William Sharpe as a tool to measure the systematic exposure that a fund has to different classes of assets. In much the same way that we can  regress the returns of a portfiolio/asset against risk fatcors to identify its exposures, we can also regress a funds returns against other more basic asset classes to infer the style of investment that the fund employs. For example, a fund that advertises itself as tracking the S\\&P 500 should have a beta of 1 with respect to te  S\\&P 500 returns and a beta of 0 with respect to other asset classes (bonds, small cap equity, T-bills, etc). By performing these regressions we can understand what kinds of asset classes, and hence what style of investment, the fund employs. Unfortunately, we cannot use a standard regression as non-zero correlations can interfere with the estimates. However, by constrainng the estimatation to ensure that all beta coefficients add up to 1 and are greater than 0 (for long only funds) we can easily circumvent this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results from Sharpe's initial analysis was striking. It found that over 90\\% of the variation ($R^{2}$) in a funds returns could be explained by the borad asset classes the fund invests in. More recent research continues to validate numbers like this. This result sent shockwaves through the funds management industry as it implied that in order to replicate the performance of a professional manager, all you needed to do was select the appropriate mix of broad asset classes. The specific assets within those classes appeared to be unimportant to fund performance. We call the selection of broad asset classes the *asset allocation decision* while the selection of specific securities within each asset class is the *security selection decision*. The work of Sharpe seemed to indicate that only asset allocation really matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation that fund managers provide no benefit beyond the broad asset classes isn't quite correct though as it ignores the intercepts of the regression. If the intercept is positive and significant, this would suggest that despite carrying the risk associated with the broad asset classes to which it is exposed, the manager has been able to extract extra return over and above what might be expected given the risk of the asset classes. The presence of alpha would then suggest that a manager has skill at security selection. What is not debated though is that asset allocation makes up a huge part of a funds performance."

    "## Changing Composition & Market Timing\n",
    "All the performance metrics considered have a common flaw. They all assume that the risk is constant over the period of the measurement. This isn't necessarily how manager behave though. If a manager believes that the equity market is about to go up, they may shift their portfolio towards equities and hence reduce their investment in other assets. This will cause the risk of their portfolio to change through time. This can lead to difficulties using the oreviously outlined performance measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can however test to see if a manager is successfully altering their portfolio allocations for the benefit of fund performanc, or if they are making alterations for another, less noble reason (see Section 24.3 of the text). This shift of wealth from an underperforming asset into an outperforming onw is called *market timing*. In its purest form, market timing involves moving moey into the equity market when it is predicted to outperform and back into the risk-free asset when the market is expected to underperform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider how we might test if a fund maager possess market timing ability, consider how the $\\beta$ of a portfolio changes as the proportion of wealth invested in the equity market changes. The portfolio beta, $\\beta_{P}$, is simply the weighted sum of all constituent betas. Say a portfolio is composed of the market portfolio and the risk free asset, then the portfolio beta is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\beta_{P} = w_{r_{f}}\\beta_{r_{f}} + (1 - w_{r_{f}})\\beta_{M}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Since $\\beta_{r_{f}} = 0$ and $\\beta_{M} = 1$, we have that\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\beta_{P} = (1 - w_{r_{f}})\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "and hence as the allocation to the risk free asset goes down (or equivalently as the allocation to the market goes up) the portfolio beta increases. We may visualise $\\beta_{P}$ as the slope of the line of best fit obtained when plotting the returns of the asset against the returns of the market (the characteristic line). Hence, if this slope changes, it could be a sign of market timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several approaches used to test for this change in slope. These involve running the regressions\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    r_{P,t} - r_{f,t} &= a + b(r_{M,t} - r_{f,t}) + c(r_{M,t} - r_{f,t})^{2} + e_{t}\\\\\n",
    "    r_{P,t} - r_{f,t} &= a + b(r_{M,t} - r_{f,t}) + c(r_{M,t} - r_{f,t})D(r_{M,t} - r_{f,t} > 0) + e_{t}\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $D(x>0)$ is a dummy variable that is 1 if $x>0$ and 0 otherwise. Both of these approaches test that if the market return is large, does the beta of the portfolio increase? If the coefficient $c$ is positive and statisticaly significant, this would suggest that when the market is ourperforming the portfolio beta is increased relative to when it is underperforming. If the coeficient $c$ isn't statistically different from 0 however, this would suggest no eveidence of market timing.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is natural to ask if it is worth that much to time the market. To understand the potential value of market timing, we can study the returns of a paper portfolio that invests in the market if its return was greater than return on T-bills and invests in T-bills if their return is larger. This procedure naturally assumes that the investor has perfect timing ability. Investments are made annually at the start of each year and begin in 1927 starting with \\$1. The results from this exercise are tabulated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | T-Bills | Equity Market | Perfect Timer |\n",

    "\n",
    "Clearly the ability to time the market perfectly is an extremely vauable skill to posess. Another way of thinking about maket timing skill is through a derivative called a call option. Call options are derivative securities that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a security at an agreed upon price (strike) at a time in the future (maturity). Naturally, if the price of the security is greater than the strike at maturity, the option holder will exercise the option, purchase for the strike price and immediatley sell in the market for the higher market price, netting them a profit. If the market price at maturity is below the strike, the investor will simply elect to not exercise their option. In this case the payoff from having this market timing option is\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\max(S_{T}, S_{0}(1+r_{f}))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $S_{T}$ is the value of the market at time $T$ and $S_{0}$ is the value of the portfolio at inititation. Options don't come free though, you have to pay a premium for them. The value of the ability to time the market then is equivalent to the present value of this call option. Using the Black-Scholes model (for which he was partly responsible) Robert Merton showed that the present value of perfect market timing ability can be written as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    PV(\\textrm{Perfect Timer}) = 2N\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma_{M}\\sqrt{T}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $N(\\cdot)$ is the normal cumulative density function, $\\sigma_{M}$ the market volatility and $T$ the time to maturity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to time the market perfectly is essentially impossible to posess. Hence we ask the question, what is the value of being an imperfect timer? By this we mean what is the value of the ability to time the market is the prediction is correct with some probability $P$. However, there are two states to predict, these being a bull market (market outperforms) and a bear market (market underperforms). Let $P_{1}$ be the correct proportion on bull predictions and $P_{2}$ be the correct proportion of bear predictions. Then Merton showed that the value of market timing is may be written as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    PV(\\textrm{Imperfect Timer}) = (P_{1} + P_{2} - 1)2N\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma_{M}\\sqrt{T}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Since $(P_{1} + P_{2} - 1) < 1$ for any form of imperfect timimg, this term reduces the value of the call option which corresponds to the value of market timing skill. As an example, say an investor could predict bull and bear markets with 70\\% accuracy. Then their value of market timing would be only 40\\% as valuable as someone who can time perfectly. AN investor who is basically flipping a coin ($P_{1} = P_{2} = 0.5$) adds no value through market timing.\n",
