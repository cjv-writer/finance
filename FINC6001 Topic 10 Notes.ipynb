    "# Active & Passive Management - II\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "Wealth management involves pooling investors wealth and investing that wealth on those investors’ behalf. At present, this industry is dominated by mutual funds. Mutual funds are large investment firms that typically offer a variety of investment options for their clients. In Australia, some of the most prominent of these funds are Superannuation funds which manage compulsory superannuation wealth for retirement. Mutual funds are regulated financial entities and, as such, must follow rules to ensure that their client’s wealth isn't exposed to too much risk. This restriction limits the kind of investments that mutual funds can make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge funds, in one sense, are like mutual funds in that they pool the wealth of many clients for the purposes of investing. However, due to their legal status, hedge funds do not have the same restrictions placed on the way they invest. This makes hedge funds an interesting topic to examine as almost all aspects of wealth management (and by extension asset pricing) can be applied to the hedge funds. Additionally, there is a vast variety of strategies employed by hedge funds, the study of which helps to shed light on the ways in which financial markets operate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hedge funds began as a relatively small component of the market but now represent a significant proportion of the wealth invested in financial markets. In 1997, hedge funds had approximately \\\\$200 billion under management but by 2018, this number had increased to around \\\\$3 trillion. This makes understanding how hedge funds interact within financial markets important to understand as they represent a growing proportion of the invested capital in the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hedge funds vs mutual funds\n",
    "We begin our discussion with the difference between hedge funds and the more commonly encountered mutual fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transparency\n",
    "The key difference between mutual and hedge funds is that mutual funds (in the US) are subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940 which is designed to protect unsophisticated investors. In Australia, it is the Corporations Act of 2001 which provides the regulatory framework. Hedge funds on the other hand are often set up as limited liability partnerships and hence are not required to provide information about their portfolio holdings to anyone who is not an investor. This means that, in general, the public is unaware of how hedge funds actually make their investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investors\n",
    "Hedge funds are usually only open to \"sophisticated investors\" whereas mutual funds are open to any and all investors. This is one of the reasons that hedge funds can make more risky investments. Their clients are typically well informed of the risks by virtue of them being sophisticated. Hedge funds don't advertise to the public and often require large investments (\\\\$500,000 - \\\\$1,000,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Investment strategies\n",
    "Mutual funds lay out their investment strategies via a prospectus. As mentioned earlier, they are also restricted in the kinds of investments they can make and consequently do not use derivatives, leverage, or short positions in any significant way. Hedge funds, on the other hand, can make significant use of all three among other exotic assets. Hedge funds may even jump around asset classes in the search of profits. One popular example of this is the hedge fund Scion Capital, made famous from the film “The Big Short”. The lead investor, Michael Burry, had previously focused on value investing in equity markets but after studying the housing market in 2004-2005, decided there was a housing bubble. He subsequently profited from the prediction that house prices would fall by using a derivative called a credit default swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liquidity\n",
    "If an investor requires their capital from a mutual fund, they can readily withdraw it. This is because mutual funds typically hold liquid assets (cash and large cap equities) which can be sold easily and quickly with little loss. Hedge funds impose a lock-up period on investors capital meaning that the investor agrees not to withdraw their capital for a period of time. This allows hedge funds to invest in far less liquid securities where the returns may be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compensation structure\n",
    "Mutual funds typically charge a proportion of funds under management (0.5-1.25\\%) as their fee. Hedge funds on the other hand charge a management fee (typically 1-2\\%) and an additional performance fee which can be between 20 and 30\\% of profits over a benchmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hedge fund strategies\n",
    "There is no unique hedge fund strategy. different hedge funds employ a variety of different strategies in the search for return. However, we can group hedge fund strategies into a few categories\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directional and non-directional strategies\n",
    "Perhaps the easiest strategy to understand is a directional strategy. This essentially involves a bet that some particular asset class or sector will outperform others (or potentially underperform in the case of short biased funds). Basically, it is a bet on a direction (up or down). Non-directional strategies on the other hand involve exploiting the relative mispricing between securities. For example, say you believe that two stocks with the same beta have different expected returns (i.e., one stock has a positive alpha while the other has an alpha of 0). These assets are mispriced relative to each other. If you were to take a long position in the positive alpha stock and a short position in the zero-alpha stock, their betas would cancel leaving you with no exposure to broad market movements. Hence, your strategy wouldn't depend on if the market went up or down, only that the stocks are mispriced relative to each other. Such a strategy is often called market neutral. Note that this long-short strategy is not risk-free. First there is the idiosyncratic risk of the firms to consider and there is also the potential the hedge fund is wrong (this is called model risk). For this reason, these strategies are often called pure plays. This name emphasizes that there is still risk involved but the bet made is on a very specific (pure) type of risk. Other extraneous forms of risk (in this case market risk) are eliminated via a hedging strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical arbitrage\n",
    "One of the hedge fund strategies that has grown popular in recent years is statistical arbitrage. While it is technically a type of market neutral strategy, it is more complex. A simple way to understand statistical arbitrage is to think about how a casino works. A casino essentially makes many bets against gambling patrons. The casino doesn't win every bet, but it wins most of the best on average due to the edge it builds into its games. Hence, in the long run, the casino will always come out ahead. The casino has a statistical arbitrage in that every bet it makes has a positive expected value and hence by making lots of bets, this value becomes more and more certain. A statistical arbitrage in a hedge fund works the same way. The hedge fund will make lots of bets (trades) with each one having a positive expected outcome. It will not be correct on all trades but on average it is and hence it will realize the value as profits. Often the statistical edge is quite small (around 1%) but because this value is earned with such low variability, due to the enormous number of trades made, the hedge fund can use leverage to inflate profits dramatically. Of course, such a strategy requires extremely good statistical modeling to be able to confidently gain an edge. These funds also require extremely fast trading systems to execute all their trades. One of the most prominent examples of a statistical arbitrage fund is the Renaissance Technologies Medallion fund, widely considered one of the most successful hedge funds ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general approach of statistical arbitrage grew out of a simple strategy called a pairs trade. The idea behind a pairs trade is to find two firms which are highly correlated. A measure is then applied to determine if one is priced high relative to the other. The firm could then take a long position in the relatively cheap firm and an offsetting short position in the relatively expensive firm. This strategy is immune to general movements (the high correlation ensures risk is diversified) but if the mispricing is correctly identified can result in abnormal returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High frequency strategies\n",
    "With an increasing level of computational sophistication, hedge funds have turned to using computers, analyzing signals from the market, to make automated trades at extremely high speed and frequency. Often the advantage held by the fund is simply that they can execute trades faster than their competitors. For example, by studying order flow (the flow of buy and sell orders that come through to the exchange) some funds can predict if there is high demand for or supply of an asset. They can then put their orders in front of other buy orders (knowing the price will increase after they have made their purchase) then sell back at a later (though potentially by only by a few seconds) time. This is called front running. Other high frequency strategies include studying electronic newsfeeds to trade before information has impacted the price (this requires special AI algorithms), trading the same asset across different markets (cross-market arbitrage) and electronic market making (earning the bid-ask spread).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portable alpha\n",
    "One of the more famous hedge fund strategies closely resembles the example provided earlier in these notes, which itself was motivated by the way in which risk is hedged in our study of APT. Portable alpha essentially involves extracting (or porting) alpha away from beta. There are a variety of strategies to achieve this, and we outline one such approach below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you identify a portfolio with a positive alpha and significant beta. You also believe that the market is about to fall, hence investing in this portfolio could produce a loss due to the beta exposure. How can you eliminate the beta but still keep the alpha? One answer is to take a long position in the portfolio and hedge the market exposure with index futures. The question that needs to be asked is how many futures contracts are required to hedge the market risk? The following video goes over an example of how to compute the appropriate hedge ratio and calculates the dollar profit from a portable alpha strategy.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Style analysis for hedge funds\n",
    "When performing style analysis on hedge funds we must take a slightly different approach to when we do the same analysis on mutual funds. Since mutual funds don't engage in short selling, our style analysis required that the regression coefficients were constrained to be positive and sum to 1. This means that the coefficients can be through of as weights for the closest replicating portfolio that can be produced from the style factors. Since hedge funds have more flexibility in their investment decisions, we can remove the constraints previously imposed for mutual funds and simply perform a standard regression to ascertain their style. The results from such a regression reveal that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Insert Style Analysis Regression Example\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "A more thorough analysis reveals that:\n",
    "* Equity market neutral funds have low exposure to the equity market\n",
    "* Short bias funds have negative exposure to the equity market\n",
    "* Distressed firm funds have exposure to credit conditions\n",
    "* Fixed income arbitrage funds have exposure to the credit spread\n",
    "\n",
    "All this evidence suggests that hedge funds are making very specific bets on very specific sources of risk in the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance measurement for hedge funds\n",
    "The performance analysis of hedge funds is a somewhat complicated task due to the non-standard ways in which hedge funds make their investments. As we have seen in the style analysis example (and those in the text), hedge funds often take non-standard forms of risk on in search of abnormal returns. Hedge funds can take on non-standard forms of risk due to their structure and rules and this can in turn provide clues about where hedge funds may in fact earn some of their return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Liquidity and hedge fund performance\n",
    "One of the key differences between hedge and mutual funds was that hedge funds can force a lock in period with investors capital. This gives hedge funds the flexibility to invest in assets which cannot be easily sold (are illiquid) as they know they do not have to return investor capital unexpectedly. This suggests that perhaps there is a premium to be earned for bearing the risk of illiquid securities. We call this liquidity risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Liquidity risk is very real. While the financial crisis of 2007-2008 was caused largely by \"toxic\" securities, it was largely exacerbated by a fall in liquidity. Banks became so concerned about counterparty risk that they refused to lend, even to previously credit worthy entities. This meant firms faced financial distress partially because they had become reliant on short term financing for their day-to-day operations which was now unavailable. Additionally7, with the huge falls in equity values, investors wanting to sell their positions typically had to do so at a price much lower than they otherwise normally would have accepted. This risk means that, other things being equal, an illiquid security would be expected to have a higher rate of return than a liquid one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One study by Aragon (2007) shows that hedge funds do hold illiquid securities. After controlling for this liquidity risk, he found that hedge fund alphas vanished suggesting their returns are compensation for bearing liquidity risk. Other authors have found that hedge fund returns exhibit positive serial correlation, a symptom of holding illiquid securities. The returns exhibit this behavior because illiquid securities don't often have observed market prices as they don't trade frequently. Hence, hedge funds must estimate their value. Given these procedures are imperfect, hedge funds use this to smooth out their returns or only mark their value to market prices slowly. In a perfectly competitive market, we would expect only small levels of serial correlation in asset returns, hence the presence of serial correlation is taken as evidence that a firm is holding illiquid securities.\n",

    "We can see from the results above that, after accounting for various risk factors, this hedge fund provides a statistically significant and positive alpha. Additionally, the exposure to the S\\&P 500 index is statistically significant, but economically quite small at around 0.2. This is however larger than might be expected for a market neutral fund. This implies that perhaps this hedge fund isn't as market neutral as advertised. It seems that the credit conditions (measured by the yield on Baa bonds over the 10-year Treasuries) is also important for explaining fund performance. This suggests that this fund is negatively exposed to worsening credit conditions which could be due to a levered position. Last, we see that changes in aggregate liquidity is also an important driver of fund returns. Also, the funds return increases as liquidity falls. This suggests that this fund may be extracting a liquidity premium and hence is likely holding relatively illiquid securities."

    "## Selection bias in performance measurement\n",
    "There are two kinds of bias that need to be understood when it comes to hedge fund performance; backfill and survivorship bias. Backfill bias refers to new hedge funds only reporting performance if their returns are sufficiently impressive to attract additional funding. Funds start with seed capital and if their performance isn't good enough, may elect not to report their returns to database providers until their performance improves, or they may simply shut the fund down. Either way, this behavior biases the performance of hedge funds as a group upwards as poorly performing funds simply don't report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Survivorship bias refers to the fact that hedge funds that fail can no longer report their performance. This means that the data we have available to analyze hedge fund performance will be biased upwards as the failed hedge funds, which would pull performance down, do not appear in our data as they haven't survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Changing factor loadings\n",
    "Given their flexibility, hedge funds can quickly alter their investment strategies to accommodate changing market conditions. This results in changing factor loadings, making the evaluation of hedge funds more difficult. The code below runs a rolling regression using a window of 60 observations and plots the coefficient for the S\\&P 500, representing exposure to the equity market."

    "We can see from the plot above that the exposure to the equity market has changed significantly through time even though this is supposed to be a market neutral fund. For example, we see that while the exposure to the S\\&P 500 has remained low for significant periods of time (including in most recent times) but during 2004, these funds increased their exposure to the equity market, likely in an effort to earn the large returns that were available then. This unfortunately led to exposure when the global financial crisis (GFC) hit in 2007 and it appears that following the GFC, these market neutral funds have reduced exposure to equities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some funds may employ derivatives in their investment strategies, and this can also affect factor loadings by creating non-linear payoff profiles. Recall the example of a perfect market timer. This is equivalent to holding a call option on the market portfolio and results in a kinked characteristic line. Similarly, some funds make extensive use of derivatives to maintain a non-linear characteristic line and consequently, any effort to analyze their factor exposure via linear methods will yield inaccurate results and not capture what the fund is doing and hence how it is performing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tail events\n",
    "The performance of some funds can be made to look good by taking on a high degree of tail risk. Tail risk refers to those events that are unlikely to occur, but when they do, they often bring catastrophic consequences. To understand tail risk, consider a fund manager who only sells deep out of the money put options. They will receive a small premium for each option and hence to produce larger gains, they sell lots of them. In most cases there will be little loss on these option positions as the market is unlikely to fall so much as to trigger exercise. However, should the market fall enough such that the option holders do exercise, then the fund would go completely bankrupt instantly. The issue with tail risk is that because it is a rare event, you can examine performance over many decades and never see it. Hence funds who are exposed to significant tail risk can go on appearing to perform well, but when a tail event happens, they lose 100\\% of their capital in a very short time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tail risk is responsible for the collapse of the largest hedge fund in history, Long Term Capital Management (LTCM). LTCM developed an arbitrage (based on the liquidity premium) which generated small, but what appeared safe returns. To increase the profit, LTCM used enormous amounts of leverage. When a tail event happened (Russian default), the arbitrage strategy stopped working due to a market \"irrationality\" known as flight to quality. Because LTCM was so highly levered, they collapsed and had to be bailed out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fee Structure\n",
    "The fee structure of hedge funds can make hedge funds act in ways that are not in line with investors best interests. A mentioned earlier, hedge funds typically charge a management fee of 1-2\\% and an incentive fee of 20-30\\% of profits. This payoff to the fund is the same as a call option and this suggests that funds will take on excess amounts of risk as options are more valuable the more risk is involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the fund makes a loss, there is often a high watermark involved. This simply means that the fund must recover all losses before it charges an incentive fee again. While at first glance this appears to protect the investors, it also incentivizes the fund to simply shutdown if they make a significant loss. All remaining capital is paid out to investors (minus management fees) and the fund is under no obligation to make up the loss as it no longer exists. The managers can bide their time and set up a new fund when the time is right. It is believed this kind of behavior is partially responsible for the high attrition rate of hedge funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, there is a significant number of hedge funds which sell themselves as funds-of-funds. This is simply a hedge fund that invests in other hedge funds (they don't have a strategy of their own). The idea is that these fund-of-funds can identify successful hedge funds and, for a fee, will invest you in the most successful ones. While this sounds reasonable, remember that when investing in a fund-of-funds you are paying fees on fees. Additionally, it is worth remembering that Bernard Madoff, the mastermind of the largest Ponzi scheme in history, obtained much of his capital via fund-of-funds. Since the management and performance fee is based on the idea of due diligence, this is a worrying fact."
